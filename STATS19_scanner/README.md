##### Credits
The [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/"), [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/), and [ggvis](http://ggvis.rstudio.com") R packages were used in this [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) app. Some of the code for the STATS19_scanner was adapted from
[Superzip](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/superzip-example.html) by Joe Cheng. The ui was inspired by [blackspot](http://blackspot.org.uk) by Ben Moore and [Twin Cities Buses](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/086-bus-dashboard/) by Aron Atkins.

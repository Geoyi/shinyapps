##### Overview
This Shiny application is designed to allow the user to interrogate road casualties reported in Greater London between 2005 and 2014.

##### Data sources
STATS19 road traffic collision data for Greater London are available from [Transport for London]
(https://www.tfl.gov.uk/corporate/publications-and-reports/road-safety) and a guide to the variables can be found [here.] (https://www.tfl.gov.uk/cdn/static/cms/documents/collision-data-guide.pdf)

##### Credits
The [leaflet](https://rstudio.github.io/leaflet/"), [DT](https://rstudio.github.io/DT/), and [ggvis](http://ggvis.rstudio.com") R packages were used in this [Shiny](http://shiny.rstudio.com) app. Some of the code for the STATS19_scanner was adapted from
[Superzip](http://shiny.rstudio.com/gallery/superzip-example.html) by Joe Cheng. The ui was inspired by [blackspot](http://blackspot.org.uk) by Ben Moore and [Twin Cities Buses](https://gallery.shinyapps.io/086-bus-dashboard/) by Aron Atkins.
